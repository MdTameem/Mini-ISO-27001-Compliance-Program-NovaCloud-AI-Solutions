# Mini-ISO-27001-Compliance-Program-NovaCloud-AI-Solutions

Beginner-friendly ISO 27001 GRC project showing how assets are identified, security controls are checked, gaps are found, and compliance documentation is created using Excel.

This project shows how a company checks its security readiness and documents gaps using ISO 27001 standards.

I acted as a Junior Compliance Analyst for a small fictional company called "NovaCloud AI Solutions". My task was to list company assets, check security rules (ISO 27001 controls), identify what is already working, and note what needs improvement.
All work is documented in Excel so that anyone – HR, manager, or even a beginner – can easily understand what was done and why.

What I Did in This Project
• Listed important company assets like servers, laptops, and SaaS tools  
• Classified assets based on importance (High / Medium)  
• Reviewed 15 ISO 27001 security controls  
• Marked each control as Implemented, Partially Implemented, or Planned  
• Assigned control owners and improvement actions  
• Documented everything clearly using Excel
